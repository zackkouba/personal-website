I was born in the Chicagoland area and have lived there all the way until college where I chose Purdue University 
in West Lafayette, IN. I grew up with a love for science and technology so it felt natural choosing engineering 
as my field, and more specifically computer engineering. Recently, I had the opportunity to explore computer 
engineering at Burns & McDonnell where, among other things, I designed an API using Visual Basic for Applications 
to integrate an existing control software with a separate SQL reporting system server. I was also given the chance 
to create a presentation and fly out to the job-site to present the solution to the client. Aside from my internship 
experiences, I am very involved in clubs at Purdue like ML@Purdue and IEEE (Purdue Aerial Robotics Team) where I am
continuing to build my experience in Python, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc. I have developed a huge passion for machine 
learning and artificial intelligence, and my goal is to continue learning both on my own and through the resources 
provided to me at Purdue and through future professional opportunities. If there is one thing you should take away 
from me, its that I am a determined learner, and I will stop at nothing to dive into a new topic and figure it out.
